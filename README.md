# CMPM-80K

Features my two game design projects for CMPM80K - Foundations of game design.

The html file is a RPG Story game made using Twine. It was created to emphasize linking logic.

SpaceQuest is my final project game and was completed with a partner. It was made using the free edition of Construct 3
